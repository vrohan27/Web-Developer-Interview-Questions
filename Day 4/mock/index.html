<!-- 1. ### What is flexbox?

Flexbox is a CSS3 layout module which provides more flexible and efficient way to align arrange and align 
the elements within the container. It is widely supported by the modern web browser. -->


<!-- 2. ### What is the difference between flex-grow and flex-shrink properties in Flexbox?

`flex-grow` is a property in Flexbox that specifies how much a flex item should grow relative to
 the other items in the container, while `flex-shrink` specifies how much a flex item should
shrink relative to the other items when there is not enough space available in the container. -->


<!-- 3. ### What is the difference between flex-wrap: nowrap and overflow: hidden in CSS?

`flex-wrap: nowrap` prevents flex items from wrapping to the next line when they overflow the container,
while `overflow: hidden` hides any content that overflows the container's boundaries. -->


<!-- 4. ### What is the `gap` property in Flexbox, and how is it used to add spacing between flex items?

The `gap` property in Flexbox sets the spacing between flex items, both horizontally and vertically.
It is a shorthand for `row-gap` and `column-gap`. -->


<!-- 5. ### How do you center an element using flexbox?

To center an element using flexbox, we need to set the parent container's display property to `flex`
and use the `justify-content` & `align-items` properties with the value of `center`. -->


<!-- 6. ### What is CSS grid?

CSS grid is a layout system in CSS that allows you to create complex, multi-dimensional grid layouts for 
web pages. -->


<!-- 7. ### How do you use the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties to define the size
and number of columns and rows in a grid?

You can use the grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows properties to define the size and number of
columns and rows in a grid. For example, you might define a grid with three columns, where the first column
is 100 pixels wide, the second column is 50% of the available width, and the third column takes up the
remaining space, with the following CSS:

    ```
    grid-template-columns: 100px 50% 1fr; -->


<!-- 8. ### How do you specify the number of columns in a grid using CSS?

You can specify the number of columns in a grid by using the `grid-template-columns` property. 
For example, `grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr)` will create a grid with three columns that
are each one fraction of the available space. -->


<!-- 9. ### How do you align items within a grid using CSS?

You can align items within a grid using the `justify-items` and `align-items` properties. justify-items
aligns items horizontally within a grid, while `align-items` aligns items vertically. -->



<!-- 10. ### What is the difference between grid-row and grid-column in CSS Grid?

`grid-row` is used to position an item within a row, while `grid-column` is used to position an item within 
a column.Both properties can take a value of either a number or a named grid line. -->


<!-- 11. ### What is a CSS transition?

A CSS transition is a way to add a gradual animation effect to an element when its CSS properties change. -->


<!-- 12. ### What is the purpose of the `transition-property` property in CSS transitions?

The `transition-property` property specifies which CSS property or properties should be 
transitioned when a change occurs. -->


<!-- 13. ### What is the function of the `transition-timing-function` property in CSS transitions?

The `transition-timing-function` property specifies the rate of change of the
transition over time. This can be used to control the speed of the transition and how it accelerates 
and decelerates. Example: `ease-in`, `ease`, `ease-out`. -->


<!-- 14. ### How do you delay the start of a CSS transition?

You can delay the start of a CSS transition using the transition-delay property. This property specifies
the amount of time to wait before starting the transition, in seconds or milliseconds. Example: 
`transition-delay: 1s;` -->


<!-- 15. ### How do you apply a transition to multiple properties at once?

You can apply a transition to multiple properties at once by separating the property names with commas in the 
`transition-property` property. example, `transition-property: background-color, color, opacity;` -->


<!-- 16. ### What are CSS 2D Transforms?

CSS 2D Transforms are a set of properties that allow you to transform the position, rotation, scaling, 
and skewing of an element in two dimensions, without affecting the surrounding elements. -->


<!-- 17. ### Can you use negative values with CSS 2D transforms? If so, what effect do they have?

Yes, you can use negative values with CSS 2D transforms. The effect of negative values depends on the 
function being used. For example, a negative value for the `rotate()` function will rotate the element 
counterclockwise instead of clockwise. -->


<!-- 18. ### What are the properties of CSS 2D transform?

    The properties of CSS 2D Transforms are:

    1. transform: specifies the transformation functions to be applied to an element
    2. transform-origin: specifies the point around which the transformation should occur
    3. translate: moves an element along the x-axis and/or y-axis
    4. rotate: rotates an element clockwise or counterclockwise around a given point
    5. scale: increases or decreases the size of an element
    6. skew: skews an element along the x-axis and/or y-axis -->



<!-- 19. ### Can you apply multiple transformations to the same element using CSS 2D transforms?

Yes, you can apply multiple transformations to the same element using CSS 2D transforms. You can do this by 
separating each transformation function with a space in the `transform` property. -->


<!-- 20. ### What is the difference between the `translate()` and `rotate()` functions?

The `translate()` function is used to move an element along the x-axis and/or y-axis, while the `rotate()`
function is used to rotate an element clockwise or counterclockwise around a given point. -->


<!-- 21. ### What are the properties of CSS 3D transform?

    The properties of CSS 3D Transforms are:

    1. transform-style: determines whether an element's children are transformed in 3D space
    2. perspective: determines the distance between the viewer and the element, affecting the appearance of 3D transforms
    3. perspective-origin: specifies the origin point of the perspective
    4. transform: applies a 3D transformation to an element, such as rotateX(), rotateY(), rotateZ(), translateX(), translateY(),translateZ(), scale(), and skew()
    5. transform-origin: specifies the origin point of the transformation
    6. backface-visibility: determines whether or not the back face of an element should be visible when the element is rotated. -->


<!-- 22. ### What is the difference between RGB and RGBA colors?

RGBA is similar to RGB, but it includes an additional alpha value that represents the opacity of the color. 
The alpha value is a number between 0 and 1, 
with 0 being completely transparent and 1 being completely opaque. -->


<!-- 23. ### What is color contrast?

Color contrast is how much the colors of the text and the background of a website stand out from each other. -->


<!-- 24. ### How does color contrast applies to accessibility in web design?

It is important because people with visual impairments or color blindness may have trouble seeing things 
if there is not enough contrast. There are guidelines for making sure there is enough contrast which makes
the website content more accessible to the people. -->


<!-- 25.  ### what is css filter?

CSS filters are a set of visual effects that can be applied to HTML elements using CSS. Filters can be 
used to adjust the appearance of an element in various ways, such as changing its color, blurring or 
sharpening it, adjusting its brightness or contrast, and more. -->
