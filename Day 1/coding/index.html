Solution Pointers:

Leverage grid-template-columns or flex-wrap for multi-column layouts.
Employ grid-auto-rows or flex-grow for automatic element resizing.
Consider CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for pre-built components. -->

<!-- Day 5: Integration with Third-Party APIs and Backend Services

Problem: Fetch data from a third-party API (e.g., weather, social media) and integrate it into your front-end application. Handle potential errors gracefully and display user-friendly feedback.

Solution Pointers:

Research the API documentation and understand its endpoints, authentication methods, and response formats.
Utilize the Fetch API or the framework's built-in HTTP client for making API requests.
Implement asynchronous programming concepts (promises, async/await) to handle data fetching.
Use error handling mechanisms (try/catch blocks) to display appropriate messages in case of issues.
Additional Tips for Success

Practice consistently: Dedicate time daily or regularly to tackle these challenges.
Research effectively: Consult online resources, documentation, and tutorials when needed.
Collaborate with others: Discuss solutions and approaches with fellow developers.
Build a portfolio: Create projects that showcase your advanced skills and problem-solving abilities.
Stay up-to-date: Continuously learn about new technologies and trends in front-end development. -->
